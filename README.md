# jwt-attack-poc
jwt-attack-poc demonstrates a proof-of-concept brute-force attack on JWT tokens signed with weak secrets. Includes scripts to generate tokens, crack weak keys, and a research report on common JWT vulnerabilities, real-world CVEs, and security best practices. For educational and research use only.

# JWT Attack PoC ‚Äì Brute Forcing Weak Secrets

## üîç Overview
This repository demonstrates how **weakly signed JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)** can be exploited through brute-force attacks. It includes:
- A script to generate a JWT with a weak secret.
- A proof-of-concept (PoC) brute-force attack to recover the secret.
